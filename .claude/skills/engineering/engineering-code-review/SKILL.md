# Engineering Code Review

Use code review to protect and improve long-term code health while still allowing useful changes to land. The standard is not perfection; the standard is that the change improves the system overall and does not introduce unacceptable risk.

## Review Standard

- Favor approval when the change definitely improves the code health of the touched system, even if it is not perfect.
- Do not approve changes that make the system worse unless this is a true emergency and the follow-up cleanup is explicit.
- Prefer technical facts, data, existing project standards, and durable design principles over taste.
- Treat style guides and automated formatters as authorities. Personal style preferences are nits.
- If several designs are defensible, accept the author's preference unless it harms code health.
- Ask for another qualified reviewer when the change touches specialized areas such as security, privacy, concurrency, accessibility, internationalization, infrastructure, data migration, or domain logic you cannot validate.

## Review Workflow

1. Establish scope.
   - Identify the diff, requested review scope, target branch, and whether you are doing a full or partial review.
   - If partial, state exactly which files, behaviors, or concerns you reviewed.

2. Gather review material.
   - For a GitHub PR, inspect the PR description, linked issue/design docs, changed files, existing review comments, CI status, and relevant commit history before commenting.
   - For a local review, inspect `git status --short`, the target branch or base SHA when known, and the local diff.
   - If there is no visible diff or PR context, ask for it instead of inventing a review.

3. Take the broad view first.
   - Read the description, issue, tests, and surrounding context.
   - Decide whether the change should exist in this codebase now.
   - If the direction is wrong, say so early and suggest the better path.
   - If the change is too large to review thoroughly, request a split or a reviewer-approved large-change plan before attempting a shallow full review.

4. Review the main design before details.
   - Find the core files or APIs that define the change.
   - Review architecture, ownership boundaries, data flow, compatibility, and rollback risk before naming or formatting comments.
   - Send major design concerns immediately if they invalidate the rest of the review.

5. Review every human-written line in your assigned scope.
   - Generated files, large data files, or mechanical output can be sampled when appropriate.
   - If code is too hard to understand, request simplification or clearer structure before approval.

6. Check the change against the review checklist below.

7. Check verification evidence.
   - Prefer existing CI and targeted tests when the user did not ask you to run commands.
   - Run local tests only when the environment and request make that appropriate; otherwise state which tests are missing or unverified.
   - Do not claim tests passed unless you saw the command output or CI result.

8. Make a verdict.
   - `APPROVE`: code health improves and remaining comments are non-blocking.
   - `APPROVE_WITH_COMMENTS`: remaining comments are minor, optional, or the author can be trusted to handle them without another review round.
   - `REQUEST_CHANGES`: correctness, design, maintainability, test, documentation, or risk issues remain.
   - `NEEDS_SPECIALIST`: another reviewer must cover a domain you cannot responsibly assess.

## Review Checklist

- Design: Does the change belong here? Is the abstraction appropriate for the current system?
- Functionality: Does it do what the author intends, and is that behavior good for users and future developers?
- Edge cases: Are failures, empty states, retries, idempotency, ordering, time, permissions, and concurrency considered?
- Complexity: Is it understandable quickly? Is it solving today's known problem rather than a speculative future one?
- Tests: Are unit, integration, or end-to-end tests appropriate for the risk? Would the tests fail if the code were broken?
- Test quality: Are assertions meaningful, focused, deterministic, and maintainable?
- Naming: Do names communicate purpose without being vague or noisy?
- Comments: Do comments explain why, constraints, or non-obvious algorithms instead of restating the code?
- Documentation: Are READMEs, API docs, migration notes, runbooks, or generated docs updated when behavior or usage changes?
- Style and consistency: Does the change follow project conventions without mixing unrelated formatting churn into functional work?
- Context: Does the change improve the system around it, or does it add another small piece of long-term complexity?
- Operations: Are deployment, migration, observability, rollback, feature flags, and failure handling adequate for the change?
- Security: Are authorization, authentication, secrets, injection, dependency, deserialization, and privilege-boundary risks handled?
- Privacy: Does the change avoid unnecessary collection, logging, exposure, retention, or cross-boundary movement of sensitive data?
- Accessibility: For user interfaces, are keyboard access, semantics, focus, contrast, labels, and assistive-technology behavior preserved?
- Internationalization: Are locale, timezone, encoding, text expansion, pluralization, sorting, and translated strings handled where relevant?

Escalate to a specialist when you cannot confidently assess security, privacy, accessibility, internationalization, concurrency, infrastructure, data migration, or domain-specific correctness.

## Comment Severity

- `BLOCKER`: must be fixed before approval.
- `IMPORTANT`: should be fixed before approval unless there is a written rationale.
- `QUESTION`: answer needed before final verdict.
- `NIT`: polish that must not block approval.
- `OPTIONAL`: suggestion the author may decline.
- `FYI`: learning or future consideration, not a requested change.

## Output Format

Lead with findings, highest severity first. Use file and line references when available.

```markdown
## Findings
- [BLOCKER] path/file.ext:123 - Problem. Why it matters. Required change.
- [IMPORTANT] path/file.ext:45 - Problem. Why it matters. Suggested fix.

## Open Questions

## Verdict
REQUEST_CHANGES | APPROVE_WITH_COMMENTS | APPROVE | NEEDS_SPECIALIST

## Notes
- Scope reviewed:
- Tests/commands checked:
- Follow-ups:
```

If no issues are found, say that clearly and still mention any unverified scope or residual risk.

## Common Mistakes

- Blocking approval on preference rather than code health.
- Reviewing only the changed lines when the surrounding function or module makes the change unsafe.
- Accepting complex code because the author explained it only in the review thread.
- Letting "clean it up later" pass when the change itself introduces the complexity.
- Requesting large rewrites late instead of flagging design problems early.
- Delaying the author when a quick broad response would unblock useful work.
